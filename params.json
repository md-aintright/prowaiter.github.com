Please view our guide below for tips on getting started with Pro Waiter and how to use the app to immediately improve the quality of service you provide your guests and increase your tips!\r\n\r\n\r\n### Step One: Edit Your Menu\r\nPro Waiter lets you customize your own menu to reflect your establishment. To reach the Menu, tap the Settings gear icon and then select Menu. \r\n\r\nFrom the Menu you should see three category tabs; All, Drinks, and Food. Select a category to create a Menu item in and tap the Add button. Use the keyboard to enter the name of your Menu item and don't forget to add the price by tapping it on the right-hand side! When you're finished, tap Done or select Return from the keyboard to add another Menu item.\r\n\r\nIf you create a Menu item in the All tab, you can later choose which category to place the item in at any time by tapping the question mark icon next to your item and selecting the category you desire. \r\n\r\n### Step Two: Order Up! \r\nTaking orders with Pro Waiter is fast and easy. Simply tap New Order from the Home screen and title your order with the table number, seat number, or name of the individual depending on the type of order you're taking. \r\n\r\nTap New Seat and use the keyboard to start typing the Menu item ordered. After the first letter is typed, Pro Waiter will automatically list all the relevant items from your custom Menu so you can select orders with just a tap! When you're finished tap Done or select Return from the keyboard to add another Food/Drink item. Add a note to your Food/Drink item for special orders and use the slider to select the quantity!\r\n\r\nForget to add a Menu item and need to order on the fly? No worries. Just type in the Food/Drink item and Pro Waiter will automatically recognize the new item and add it to your Menu for next time!\r\n\r\nThe food service business moves fast, so keep up with Pro Waiter. Get all the information you need about a specific order in two taps! See the total table info from the Home screen, including number of seats, check total, tip estimator, and timer. For more info just tap the order and you'll see the specific orders for each individual seat as well.\r\n\r\n### Step Three: Timing is Everything\r\nUse Pro Waiter's Timer Notification System to stay on top of your tables and orders. Simply tap the Timer from the individual order screen and set the desired time along with the name of the reminder. \r\n\r\nNo more cold soups or late checks! \r\n\r\n### Step Four: Let Us Do The Math \r\nVisit the Check Calculator feature through the Settings gear icon from the Home screen to automatically calculate the check with your establishment's specifications. \r\n\r\nAdd tax percentage, additional service charges, and even estimate the tip you'll receive for individual orders by entering the percentage in decimal format. Pro Waiter will automatically calculate check totals using the information you input and the Menu item prices. \r\n\r\n### Step Five: Remember without Remembering \r\nUsing Pro Waiter's built-in notepad you can keep track of important notes such as daily specials, nightly spiels, or 86'd Menu items.\r\n\r\nVisit the notepad by tapping the Settings gear icon from the Home screen and selecting Spiels & Specials. Add a new note by tapping the Plus icon. \r\n\r\nPro Waiter even gives you the ability to email notes so you can share shift schedules, opening/closing duties, or 86'd Menu items with your co-workers!\r\n\r\n### Thanks for using Pro Waiter!\r\nPlease spread the word by rating Pro Waiter and sharing with your friends and Family! \r\n\r\nIf you have any additional questions or concerns please contact us at md.enright@gmail.com as we're always looking to improve the Pro Waiter experience!"}
